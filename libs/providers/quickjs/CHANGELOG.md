# @langchain/quickjs

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#261](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/pull/261) [`454fa26`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/commit/454fa268041a5ad08af2eff991102079e5d5d50b) Thanks [@hntrl](https://github.com/hntrl)! - feat(quickjs): add `@langchain/quickjs` — sandboxed JavaScript/TypeScript REPL tool
  - New `createQuickJSMiddleware()` providing a WASM-sandboxed QuickJS REPL (`js_eval` tool) with VFS integration, TypeScript support, top-level await, and cross-eval state persistence
  - Programmatic tool calling (PTC): expose any agent tool as a typed async function inside the REPL for code-driven orchestration, batching, and parallel execution
  - Environment variable isolation with secret management: opaque placeholders for secrets, per-tool allowlists, and file-write leak prevention
  - AST-based transform pipeline (acorn + estree-walker + magic-string) for TypeScript stripping, declaration hoisting, and auto-return
